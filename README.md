A MODERN DAY (Hijrah) TIME HAS DICTATED AND DETERMINED FREEDOM, JUSTICE & EQUALITY
The Perfect Time To Build Our Own Economic System

Let's make this movement vital.

1.) Why celebrate the murder of innocent people of color, and then, call it Black History month?
2.) Do you believe that people of color would be better off here in America governing themselves?
3.) Do you believe that the people of Color are systematically oppressed?
